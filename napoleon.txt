The Napoleon Bonaparte


Origins and education
---------------------

Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769, to Carlo Maria di Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, in his family's ancestral home Casa Buonaparte in Ajaccio, 
the capital of the island of Corsica. He was their fourth child and third son. This was a year after the island was transferred to France by the Republic 
of Genoa.[14] He was christened Napoleone di Buonaparte, probably named after an uncle (an older brother who did not survive infancy was the first of the 
sons to be called Napoleone). In his 20s, he adopted the more French-sounding Napoleon Bonaparte.[15][note 2]

The Corsican Buonapartes were descended from minor Italian nobility of Tuscan origin, who had come to Corsica from Liguria in the 16th century.[16][17]

His father Nobile Carlo Buonaparte was an attorney, and was named Corsica's representative to the court of Louis XVI in 1777. The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, Letizia Ramolino, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child.[18] Napoleon's maternal grandmother had married into the Swiss Fesch family in her second marriage, and Napoleon's uncle, the cardinal Joseph Fesch, would fulfill a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for some years.

He had an elder brother, Joseph, and younger siblings: Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and Jerome. A boy and girl were born before Joseph but died in infancy. Napoleon was baptised as a Catholic.[19]

Napoleon's noble, moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical Corsican of the time.[20] In January 1779, he was enrolled at a religious school in Autun. In May, he was admitted to a military academy at Brienne-le-Chateau.[21] His first language was Corsican, and he always spoke French with a marked Corsican accent and never learned to spell French properly.[22] He was teased by other students for his accent and applied himself to reading.[23] An examiner observed that Napoleon "has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics. He is fairly well acquainted with history and geography... This boy would make an excellent sailor".[24][note 3]

On completion of his studies at Brienne in 1784, Napoleon was admitted to the elite Ecole Militaire in Paris. He trained to become an artillery officer and, when his father's death reduced his income, was forced to complete the two-year course in one year.[26] He was the first Corsican to graduate from the Ecole Militaire.[26] He was examined by the famed scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace.[27]


Early career
------------

Upon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in La Fere artillery regiment.[21][note 4] He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, and took nearly two years' leave in Corsica and Paris during this period. At this time, he was a fervent Corsican nationalist, and wrote to Corsican leader Pasquale Paoli in May 1789, "As the nation was perishing I was born. Thirty thousand Frenchmen were vomited on to our shores, drowning the throne of liberty in waves of blood. Such was the odious sight which was the first to strike me".[29]

He spent the early years of the Revolution in Corsica, fighting in a complex three-way struggle among royalists, revolutionaries, and Corsican nationalists. He was a supporter of the republican Jacobin movement, organising clubs in Corsica,[30] and was given command over a battalion of volunteers. He was promoted to captain in the regular army in July 1792, despite exceeding his leave of absence and leading a riot against French troops.[31]

He came into conflict with Paoli, who had decided to split with France and sabotage the French assault on the Sardinian island of La Maddalena.[32] Bonaparte and his family fled to the French mainland in June 1793 because of the split with Paoli.[33]


Ruler of France
---------------
While in Egypt, Bonaparte stayed informed of European affairs. He learned that France had suffered a series of defeats in the War of the Second Coalition.[74] On 24 August 1799, he took advantage of the temporary departure of British ships from French coastal ports and set sail for France, despite the fact that he had received no explicit orders from Paris.[68] The army was left in the charge of Jean Baptiste Kleber.[75]

Unknown to Bonaparte, the Directory had sent him orders to return to ward off possible invasions of French soil, but poor lines of communication prevented the delivery of these messages.[74] By the time that he reached Paris in October, France's situation had been improved by a series of victories. The Republic, however, was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular with the French population.[76] The Directory discussed Bonaparte's "desertion" but was too weak to punish him.[74]

Despite the failures in Egypt, Napoleon returned to a hero's welcome. He drew together an alliance with director Emmanuel Joseph Sieyes, his brother Lucien, speaker of the Council of Five Hundred Roger Ducos, director Joseph Fouche, and Talleyrand, and they overthrew the Directory by a coup d'etat on 9 November 1799 ("the 18th Brumaire" according to the revolutionary calendar), closing down the council of five hundred. Napoleon became "first consul" for ten years, with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only. His power was confirmed by the new "Constitution of the Year VIII", originally devised by Sieyes to give Napoleon a minor role, but rewritten by Napoleon, and accepted by direct popular vote (3,000,000 in favor, 1,567 opposed). The constitution preserved the appearance of a republic but in reality established a dictatorship.[77][78]
